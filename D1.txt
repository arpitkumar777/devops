-Kernel
-Linux(modular), Unix, Redhat

Linux has monolithic kernel, meaning the core of the OS is a single program. It's a mono kernel with modularity. This is achieved through Loadable Kernel Modules.
Linux is modular bcz it has different separated components which we can bring together and build what we want.

-open source income source? Nominal charge.
-www.kernel.org working, who donates, CSR(Corporate Social Responsibility)
-Ubuntu/Suse/--Garuda/Mint/Kali
-daily update
-in production, most of the things run over CLI as it does not consume too much resources./ cutting down the cost of the company/scalability/avail/redundancy.
-switching from redhat to Linux.

HW-Kernel-OS-Shell/Interface.

Why Linux?
Cloud Computing | IAC | Ansible, Cheph, Puppet | openshift | Openstack | Kubernetes | Terraform | splunk
RAM, Networking, etc - expensive.
Local machine vs Kick start - pre execution environment.

VMware EXXI - Interface hypervisor | will virtualise.
Citrix - xen
Redhat - Rhev and KVM(Kernel based Virtualisation)
Microsoft - Hyper - v

Types of Hypervisor.
Type 1(Bare metal) and Type 2(Hosted)

ISO file - An ISO file(archive of an optical disk) is a single-file, exact digital replica of an entire optical disc like a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray, containing all its data, folders, and file system structure

Modules will load from DVD to RAM, after install they will move to Drive.
Boot loader, installer(Anaconda) - it controls the entire process. moves modules/media to hard disk, next time machine will execute from hard disk.

PATA
SDA - disk naming convention. Sata Disk A(disk number) | Sata disk 1, Sata disk 2.
SATA, MSATA, NVME(faster).
Automatic vs Custom.

/root partition(C drive) 18gb
Total space - 236k
Linux do not crash, as it creates partition.
/boot 400m
create virtual space (ohm killers add-on)
Swap 1K
partitions comes under system.
If kernel crashes, files can be copied, no system crash.
/var/....(default documentary root)

Create FTP server - /var/ftp/hub - 1G.
Temp partition in Linux

OS is not imp | Confg is imp.
Create dedicated partition for everything.

We can create any no. of partitions as per requirement.
boot is a separate file.
Vib linus.
Copy Vib linus content to boot folder
Existing datas are deleted.

3 roots of Linux 
Root user (root)
Root home directory (/)
Root user's home directory (/root)

root direc is resp for storing root user info
anaconda helps in installation process.

ctrl shift + for inc font
using root in terminal.
why you are executing on root and why not regular user? it is possible - yes, because root allows us to make system-wide changes.
whoami
su -
password aaaa
switched to regular user.
# she reg user

hostname to check hostname
hostnamectl set-hostname custom-name to set new name, ct1 is not a command, rather a suffix which stands for controller node.
will not reflect in current session, only work after restart.
can type bash
bash forces the machine to explicitly take the name without closing the current session.

ip a s will show the address - ens160 is ethernet 

Host - vm never communicate to world
NAT(network address translation) working. - comm with world
Bridge - comm between virtual and local machine

dig google.com
ping google.com
VM gets the address from the cloud.
Every vm will have 2 ips - pub and pvt. dont change pvt ip. pub ip is responsible for accessing the VM.

ll vs ls
total 4 | anaconda-ks.cfg

cat command to read the file.

nl vs ll
press q to quit

touch swayam.txt

whoami
-root
su - root name.

mkdir devops 
ll
blue col - folders
white col - files

rm xyz.txt to remove the file
su - 
ctrl l to clear
root user cannot delete directly the txt file but regular user can delete.
rm --help
rm -f will delete from root user

#alias

i(interactive) mode in root mode vs regular mode in regular user.
ls = ls -l automatically

creating own aliases 
#alias cls = clear 

#alias
cls = clear will be added

How to delete the alias?
gets deleted after each session automatically.

# cal
# cal -3
# cal --h (help)
# useradd --help
# man useradd , man means manual.

3 users in Linux
user admin
   |
    --- super user
    --- root(auto create)
    --- power user(created by machine)
    --- admin
   |
    --- system user - (httpd, smbd, sshd) d- demons 
   |
    --- normal user(created by root)
	swayam
	xyz
	etc
	ajit

os automatically creates system user which is responsible to control the service, as per the command it can enable, disable. System user controls the particular service. System users also instructs apache.

in aws
copy ssh url to terminal(open right click-in downloads where key pair is present


# useradd Sanjaya
info about Sanjaya is stored somewhere which is /etc/passwd
# cat /etc/passwd
: is field separator
first no. is uid - user id
second number(similar) is group id, by default user is a part of primary group
group are of 2 types - primary and secondary, always add in secondary group
home/Sanjaya is the home directory
everything is assigned by system user

uid is unique for every user
root uid = 0
system user uid = 1-999
normal user uid = 1000+

# vim /etc/passwd

# passwd Sanjaya to set password for user Sanjaya.
tab auto completion feature is present in Linux.

cat stands for concatenate and it helps to read file contents.
/etc/shadow is a plain text file which stores secure user account information. It is the most protected file related to user management on a Linux system.

#cat /etc/shadow , displays the content of shadow file

3 dollars are present in pw 
first dollar and second dollar - sha512(encrypt method) - used to encrypt password
before third dollar- salt value salt is a random string of chars added to the pw before it is hashed.
salt value never matches.
after third dollar, comes password.

UID max 60000

user ageing policy
# vim /etc/login.defs
# chage -d 5 -E 10 -I 3 -m 30 -M 99 -W 15 devops , devops user's policy is changed
# cat /etc/shadow
# vim /etc/ login


#useradd Aditya 
passwd Aditya
*****
#cat /etc shadow to see policies. 
policies will be same for every user.

root is not restricted user, can move in any working direc

#usermod -s /sbin/nologin jacksparrow - no one can login from his account. disable a user's ability to log into the system via shell.
shell is changed
/sbin - directory in Linux file system that contains essential system binaries for system administration.
-s stands for shell. -s flag tells the usermod command to set the user's login shell to /bin/bash
usermod -s/bin/bash jacksparrow - acc is unlocked--enter into jacksparrow, changes user's default login shell to bash exit to return to root.

usermod --h

#userdel jacksparrow
#cat /etc/passwd | grep -i jacksparrow , grep is used to find

after every useradd, new home direc is created.

#useradd -d /home/jacksparrow/ swayam - swayam will replace jacksparrow, so //no new home direc will be created. swayam can now access jacksparrow's content.
//userdel will not remove datas.
#su -swayam
// permission will be denied.
#cat /etc/passwd | grep -i swayam
//error will occur
#touch kk
//permission denied
we have to change permission
#chown swayam /home/jacksparrow
#chgrp swayam /home/jacksparrow
